### About this tool:

This tool was developed by **[zd小达](https://zhangda.xyz/)** using HTML+CSS+JS and packaged with Electron, supporting Windows and Linux systems. (unfortunately, not compatible with Mac because I don't have one...). Sincere thanks to all the open-source projects used 🧎**🧎**🧎.

### Tool Features:

#### Simple Functionality 😊

I say it's only for roll call, and it really is just for roll call, nothing else...

#### Beautiful Interface 😁

Using the MDUI framework ensures an aesthetically pleasing presentation regardless of the usage.

#### No Haphazard File Generation in Other Directories 😎

The tool will ensure compliance with Microsoft standards by avoiding the random generation of files in other directories during its first use.

#### Easy to Use 👍

There are less than ten buttons, making it easy for even the most senior teachers at the school to use.

#### Strong Compatibility 😏

Whether you are using Windows or any other Linux distribution, you can easily utilize it.~

#### Large Font for Easy Viewing on Big Screen Devices 😃

The use of a large typeface ensures comfortable legibility on bigger displays.
